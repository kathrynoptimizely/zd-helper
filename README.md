# Zendesk 2.0 Helper App

This app was created to assist in the rollout of Zendesk 2.0. The app pulls information from the ticket, user and organization tables and displays it in three tabs. There is also functionality to restrict ticket saves where required tickets are not populated, as well as display notifications to Zendesk users when certain conditions are true (e.g. account is inactivate).
